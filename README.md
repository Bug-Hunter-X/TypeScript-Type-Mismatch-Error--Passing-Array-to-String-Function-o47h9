# TypeScript Type Mismatch Bug

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an array to a function expecting a string argument.  The `greeter` function expects a string, but an array is passed, resulting in a runtime error or unexpected behavior.

The solution demonstrates how to correct this by either modifying the function signature or the way the argument is passed to properly match the expected type.
